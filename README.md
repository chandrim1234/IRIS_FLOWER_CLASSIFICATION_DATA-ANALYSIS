Description of the Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset contains measurements of various characteristics of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

There are three species of iris flowers in the dataset: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Each species has 50 samples, resulting in a total of 150 samples in the dataset.

The dataset is balanced, meaning it contains an equal number of samples for each class.

EXPLANATION COLUMNS
The Iris dataset consists of measurements of various characteristics of iris flowers belonging to three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The four features measured for each flower are:

Id
Sepal length (in centimeters)
Sepal width (in centimeters)
Petal length (in centimeters)
Petal width (in centimeters)
Species The dataset contains a total of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three species. It is often used for tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization.
Summarizing the report findings, here are the results of the analysis :
LINE PLOT
Plot a line graph showing the sepal length of the three species of Iris flowers.Use different colors to represent each species.


Scatter Plot
Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between the petal length and petal width.Use different colors to represent each species


Histogram
Plot a histogram showing the distribution of the petal widths. Use different colors to represent each species and display a legend.


Bar Plot
Create a bar plot showing the average sepal width for each species


Pie Chart
Assume that the dataset represents the entire population of Iris flowers. Create a pie chart showing the proportion of each species in the population.


Box Plot
Create a box plot showing the distribution of sepal length for each species.


Pairplots
Combine the scatter plot and the histogram into one figure by using pairplots.


Conclusion :
The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset used for machine learning and statistical analysis. It contains measurements of features from three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Key conclusions drawn from analyzing the dataset include feature importance, classification of species, model evaluation, comparison of algorithms, and insights into flower morphology. Overall, it serves as a valuable resource for learning and experimenting with various data analysis techniques.
