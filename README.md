## Description of the Iris Dataset:

- The Iris dataset contains measurements of various characteristics of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

- There are three species of iris flowers in the dataset: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

- Each species has 50 samples, resulting in a total of 150 samples in the dataset.

- The dataset is balanced, meaning it contains an equal number of samples for each class.

## EXPLANATION COLUMNS:
The Iris dataset consists of measurements of various characteristics of iris flowers belonging to three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The four features measured for each flower are:

- Id
- Sepal length (in centimeters)
- Sepal width (in centimeters)
- Petal length (in centimeters)
- Petal width (in centimeters)
- Species The dataset contains a total of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three species. It is often used for tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization.


## Summarizing the report findings, here are the results of the analysis :
